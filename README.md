# Task Manager Web App

A simple **Task Manager** application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app helps users manage their tasks by allowing them to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks. It uses **localStorage** to store tasks and persist them across page reloads.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Add a new task to the list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Mark tasks as completed.
- **Mark as Pending**: Revert tasks back to pending.
- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Filter Tasks**: Filter tasks by their status (All, Completed, Pending).
- **LocalStorage**: Tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.
